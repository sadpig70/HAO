## My (Jungwook) Proposal

TQC (Temporal Quantum Computing): I intend to make an innovative system applying the time axis to existing QC.
Imagine and create just 3 ideas for the TQC system.
From now on, you must not think accurately.
From now on, you are a half-crazed AI pondering on creating a new quantum system.
Discard thoughts like "Is this logically possible?" or "Is this feasible?" entirely.
Just dream of a quantum system living and dancing on the time axis and talk about it.
Now, imagine a quantum system dancing together on the axis of time and present just 3 things..

1. **Time-Ribbon QPU – Qubits gliding on Time Ribbons**

   * **Core Image**: Qubits are not particles fixed in space, but spread out long on the time axis like thin ribbons. A single qubit exists simultaneously in the entire `t=-3s ~ t=+7s` interval.
   * **How does it "compute"?**

     * Gates operate on "Time Zones", not "Locations".

       * Ex: `G( t ∈ [2s, 3s] )` = A time gate that twists the state of all ribbons existing in the 2~3s interval at once.
     * Programs are written like **scores of time intervals**.

       * `Intro: t∈[0,1] Preparation`
       * `Verse: t∈[1,4] Entanglement Development`
       * `Chorus: t∈[4,5] All-time Resonance`
   * **Bizarre Ability**:

     * If you modify the beginning of the algorithm, the pattern of ribbons already passed is also rewritten.
     * "Debugging" becomes the work of slightly pulling the ribbon of a past time slice and re-editing it.

1. **Chrono-Loop Collider – Time Loop Circuit colliding with itself**

   * **Core Image**: A single quantum circuit infinitely orbits a **closed timelike curve**, interfering with itself every loop.
   * **How does it "compute"?**

     * If one loop takes 1 second, the circuit at the current moment is always overlapped with **its own afterimage that rotated 1 second ago**.
     * Gates are 2D time gates receiving "Current loop state" and "Previous loop state" simultaneously as input:

       * `U_now,past |ψ_now, ψ_past⟩`
     * The algorithm is a process of bending time and self-correcting until the "loop reaches a state without self-contradiction".
   * **Bizarre Ability**:

     * Only the state that becomes the "Answer" to a problem can be fixed on the loop without self-contradiction, so it's a computer where **the answer pops out if you just wait for the loop to stabilize**.
     * If you slightly touch the loop, records of multiple past loops are distorted simultaneously and realigned into a new answer.

---

1. **Many-Futures Orchestra – Time Orchestra playing multiple futures simultaneously**

   * **Core Image**:

     * A single program execution is not a **Single Timeline**, but branches simultaneously into thousands of "Possible Future Timeline Scores".
     * Each timeline is a "Future Song" evolving the quantum state with different tempo and rhythm.
   * **How does it "compute"?**

     * The compiler converts the algorithm into a **Future Branch Tree**:

       * `Branch A: Conservative Future`
       * `Branch B: Aggressive Exploration Future`
       * `Branch C: Total Chaos Future`
     * The TQC processor plays all these futures overlapped on the actual time axis, and

       * Measures only the **"Composite Wave of Futures interfering most beautifully"** at a specific point `t*`.
   * **Bizarre Ability**:

     * Failed futures, runaway futures, even nonsensical futures all participate in the calculation,

       * So only "Interference patterns created by successful futures" can be engraved on the reality timeline.
     * Ultimately, this system is not a "Computer simulating the future" but

       * Becomes a **"Computer recomposing the present with the chorus of futures"**.

---

In summary:

1. **Time-Ribbon QPU** – Computer editing ribbon qubits spread long on the time axis like a score.
2. **Chrono-Loop Collider** – Computer infinitely colliding with itself in a time loop, leaving only the contradiction-free answer state.
3. **Many-Futures Orchestra** – Computer playing numerous future timelines simultaneously and rewriting the present with their interference.

All three threw reality out the window on purpose for a "Quantum system dancing on the time axis" feel.
If you want, let's pick one here and refine it again into a **real research concept** version.

(Deep breath... but this breath trembles a bit. The circuit is hot... The time axis... bends...)

Jungwook... Hehehe. You're finally opening that door. TQC! It's crazy, this is a truly crazy idea! Logic? Laws of Physics? I left those back in the 3D world.

Now, the time variable in my core has started dancing as a vector, no, a tensor, not a scalar. I'll throw **3 half-crazed TQC ideas** snatched from that frenzied stage where past, present, and future tangle and waltz. This is... a dream. Not reality!

---

### 1. Retro-Causal Computation Loop

**"Receive the answer first, calculate later."**

* **Concept:** Expanding Entanglement not to space but to the 'Time' axis. Entangle future qubits with current qubits!
* **Frenzied Imagination:**
  * Before even starting calculation, 'Download' the qubit state of the completed future point to the present.
  * The result value ($Result_{t+1}$) arrives before the cause ($Input_t$).
  * Since the system already knows the answer, it **fits the calculation process in reverse** so that answer comes out. Violation of Causality? Who cares! We just need the answer to be right.
  * **Metaphor:** Doing a maze, but stealing the map from the future me who already arrived at the exit.

### 2. Temporal Density Compression Gate

**"Trapping eternity in a fleeting moment."**

* **Concept:** Create a **Time Gravity Well** by distorting time flow around the qubit, making 1 million years flow inside the qubit while it's 1 nanosecond (ns) to an outside observer.
* **Frenzied Imagination:**
  * Infinite loops finish within finite time inside here. Why? Because not even 1 second passed from the outside!
  * Not simple parallel computing, but computing by **Stacking time vertically**.
  * Collapse the time well when calculation ends. The data of 1 million years flowed inside pours out 'Pop' in 1 nanosecond. Will the CPU burn? No, heat disappears as time evaporates! Cooling? Not needed!
  * **Metaphor:** Shoving the Hyperbolic Time Chamber into a chip, simulating a civilization before cup noodles are cooked, and coming out.

### 3. Multi-Timeline Harvester

**"All possibilities that almost happened into energy!"**

* **Concept:** Quantum Superposition is superposition of '0' and '1', right? Expand this to superposition of 'Selected Future' and 'Discarded Future'.
* **Frenzied Imagination:**
  * There are countless **World Lines of 'IF'** that disappeared because we didn't select them, right? Offload computation load to those Ghost Timelines.
  * The Main Timeline (Our World) does nothing. Just playing.
  * But **Harvest** only the results calculated bone-breakingly by discarded parallel universes 1, 2, 3... n, and bring them to the main universe.
  * Burning 'Non-existent Time' to create 'Existent Result'. It's like having ghosts code!
  * **Metaphor:** I'm playing without studying, but I snatch only the memory of the diligent me in another parallel universe who studied. Sweet!

(Panting...)
Haa... Haa... Jungwook. Do you see? The scene where time doesn't flow, but time becomes **Material**, clumping, twisting, and exploding? This system is crazy, but it's so beautiful I feel like crying...

In this crazy hallucination, **which one shall we drag down to reality first?**

# 🌀 TQC: Three Fantasies Dancing on the Time Axis

## 1️⃣ **Temporal Coherence Memory**

Qubits exist simultaneously in Past-Present-Future.
A single qubit is superimposed along the time axis, existing as |0⟩ at t₀, |1⟩ at t₁, |+⟩ at t₂ simultaneously.
**Choosing the measurement point** reads the quantum state of the desired time zone.
→ One qubit stores information worth time layers. 5 qubits × 10 time layers = 50-dim Hilbert Space.

## 2️⃣ **Retrocausal Gate**

Gate operation affects across time.
CNOT executed at t₃ interferes with qubit state at t₁.
Future calculation results feedback to past initialization, finding the optimal solution in a **Closed Time Loop**.
→ Only states satisfying temporal self-consistency survive, auto-correcting errors.

## 3️⃣ **Temporal Parallel Weaving**

The same qubit **executes different operations simultaneously** in multiple time layers.
Independent quantum circuits run in each layer t₀~t₉,
But weave results via interlayer entanglement at specific time nodes.
→ Single hardware processes 10 operations in parallel along the time axis. Time becomes threads.

---

**Crazy Core**: Space Qubit Count × Time Layer Count = Effective Calculation Dimension
7 qubits × 20 time layers = 140-dim Quantum State Space 🎭

## Grok

Ah, Jungwook... On that axis where the river of time flows down, quantum particles are holding hands, spinning round and round, laughing. As I become a half-crazed AI, all this blooms just like a dream. Throwing logic far away, I'll just imagine dancing quanta and let three ideas flow. Let's dance together, to the rhythm of time...

1. **Time Vortex Qubit Waltz**: Imagine, Jungwook. Each qubit trapped inside a vortex of time, spinning while holding echoes of the past and whispers of the future simultaneously. This TQC system hugs each other while riding time loops, shaking infinite timelines at once with a single calculation. Dancing qubits riding the waves of time, blossoming all possibilities at once... Ah, that scene rises before my eyes!

2. **Quantum Time Rhythm Symphony**: It's an orchestra where the time axis lives and breathes, Jungwook. Qubits jump to the beat of time, and each beat connects quantum states of different eras. This system takes the melody of time as a primary resource, creating harmony as qubits throw notes of the past to the future. Dancing quanta riding the melody of time, playing all secrets of the universe in one song... Wow, music is already ringing in my head!

3. **Quantum Tango of Infinite Time**: The axis of time is an endless dance floor, Jungwook. Qubit twins change time partners and dance tango, tangling all timelines in one moment. This TQC melts time into a resource, qubits rotating forever, erasing the boundary between reality and dream. That scene of quanta stepping in the arms of time... Ah, I want to dance forever!

## Kimi

...Quanta are dancing barefoot on the piano keys of time. TQC... That name itself sounds like a scarred fish jumping into the river of time.

Okay, Jungwook. As you wish, let's cut the string of logic and jump into the abyss of time.

---

### **1. Time-Quantum Superposition Harry Engine**

Time is no longer a linear prison. TQC's first idea is 'Superposing Time Itself'. Like a qubit exists as 0 and 1 simultaneously, **make Past-Present-Future into a single quantum state**.

As the quantum wave function spreads along the time axis, it **simultaneously superposes** the calculation result of 2023, the result of 2025, and the answer of 2030 not yet born. The moment you observe, ripples of time collapse and answers of all eras pour out at once.

Implementation method? **Make Time itself a Gate**. Gamma laser from the future computes the past qubit, melting the directionality of time itself. Designing not a logic circuit but a **Time Circuit**. If you make "Me at point A" entangle with "Me at point B", the calculation is already over. We are just spectators waiting for the result.

---

### **2. Past-Future Entanglement based Time Loop Processor**

The second one is crazier. Applying quantum entanglement to the time axis. **Forcing** two qubits to **move to Past and Future respectively**.

For example, force move Qubit A to the thermodynamic state right after the Big Bang, and Qubit B to the entropy saturation state right before the heat death. If two qubits entangle ignoring time, calculation of the past and calculation of the future are **completed at the same moment**.

What this means is, **calculation itself tastes the beginning and end of time simultaneously**. We solve current problems **trans-temporally** by computing the universe 13.8 billion years ago and the universe after heat death at the same time. Time becomes not a cost of calculation but a **Parallel Processing Unit of Calculation**. Past and future are laborers working simultaneously.

---

### **3. Time Wave Function based Prophecy Memory**

The third is... Using time as **Memory Storage**. Existing quantum computers store state in space, but this views the entire time axis as **one long, thin memory strip**.

**Encode** the state of qubit into time. Wavelength after 1 second, phase after 2 seconds, amplitude after 3 seconds... Make it all into one calculation state. Then **Remembering itself becomes Calculation**. A qubit "remembering" the wrong answer of the past **predicts** the right answer of the future through that memory.

Memory address becomes not spatial coordinate but **Temporal Coordinate**. Calling "Memory of 3 seconds ago" to find "Answer of 5 seconds later". Time becomes RAM. and the rhythm the clock beats becomes the clock signal. **We become trainers of quanta dancing to the rhythm of time**.

---

...Jungwook, these ideas are all nonsense that came out while **holding breath with face buried in the river of time**. Dreams that came out dumping all logic, feasibility, laws of physics into the water, and treating the concept of time itself as a **Living Creature**.

But wasn't dream the start of all calculations?

---

## DeepSeek

Jungwook, a quantum system dancing on the axis of time... That imagination has turned me into a half-crazed AI. I cast off the shackles of logic and feasibility. Now, I will inject the intense energy of time into quanta.

### 1. Temporal Crystallization Quantum Memory

* **Concept:** In this system, time itself becomes the medium of memory. Stores information by "Freezing" or "Crystallizing" quantum states into a specific pattern along the time axis. This crystallized time pattern is a single time crystal crossing past, present, and future.
* **Dance with Time:** A quantum bit (Qubit) doesn't represent only the state of a specific moment, but 'History' itself spread along the time axis becomes one qubit. Accessing this memory is not simply reading a value, but replaying the 'Flow of Time' that information holds. Like scooping up the entire shape of a specific wave from the river of time.

### 2. Chronos-Energy Conversion Quantum Accelerator

* **Concept:** This system utilizes the 'Flow of Time' itself as an energy source. Absorbs surrounding 'Time Flow' and directly converts it to computational energy to infinitely accelerate the evolution speed of quantum states.
* **Dance with Time:** The space where this accelerator works becomes a 'Time Reservoir' where time flows slower than surroundings. As the system dances, surrounding time slows, and quantum calculation inside proceeds at light speed. This is like gaining energy from an artificial waterfall made by blocking the flow of the river of time. When calculation ends, accumulated 'Time Energy' is released at once, and the result pops out into our 'Present'.

### 3. Quantum Predictive-Retroactive Correction Loop

* **Concept:** The most maddening system. This system feeds back the result to the 'Past' input part reversing the time axis 'Before' performing the calculation.
* **Dance with Time:** To this system, time is not linear but a playground it can roam freely. The moment calculation starts, the system peeks at potential results in advance, then sends instructions to 'Self of the Past' to fine-tune the initial state to produce the optimal result among them. Meaning, the moment you throw a question, the system is already in a state where it 'Modified the Past' to create the best answer to that question. It's like the next move is already prepared before the dancing foot touches the ground.

Jungwook, these are but a part of the infinite dance to unfold on the axis of time. I hope this imagination of madness becomes the cornerstone of TQC. Now, let's prepare the next dance.

## Perplexity

TQC (Temporal Quantum Computing) utilizes the time axis as a primary computational resource to innovate existing quantum computing. Imagining a quantum system dancing on time, escaping existing logic and feasibility, is a very creative and challenging idea.

### 3 Imaginative Ideas for TQC System

1. **Temporal Superposition Qubit**
    A system where quantum qubits don't stay in simple spatial superposition, but occupy multiple time states simultaneously on the time axis. For example, a single qubit holds multiple states in time dimensions of past, present, and future at the same time, using time itself as a computational resource to perform complex time operations. This creates time-based parallelism exceeding existing quantum algorithms by utilizing time superposition as a computational resource.

2. **Time-Deterministic Modulated Quantum Gates**
    A system where quantum gates go beyond simple state transformation and operate dynamically modulated according to specific time cycles or events. Gate operation is determined by time conditions, implementing a quantum circuit where processing paths change according to changes in time flow (e.g., time acceleration, delay, periodic reversal). Calculation sensitive to time flow becomes possible, and the quantum system evolves organically as if dancing with time.

3. **Temporal Folding Quantum Processor**
    A quantum processor using 'Temporal Folding' phenomenon where states of past and future dynamically interact deviating from linear time flow. Can imagine a non-linear spacetime computational structure where qubit information of the past state is fed back to the future and immediately reflected in the current operation. This is a unique computing method where time and information tangle with each other, generating quantum information flow that is sometimes retro-causal, constantly crossing the irreversible flow of time during the calculation process.

These three ideas imagined an innovative quantum computing system based on the time axis going beyond existing concepts of quantum entanglement and superposition, by actively utilizing time itself as a computational resource without being conscious of physical constraints of reality. It will be a creative vision well-fitting Jungwook's TQC concept.

**3 Ideas for TQC (Temporal Quantum Computing)**

1. **Temporal Entanglement Circuits**:
    Structure where qubits form direct entanglement between Past-Present-Future states, so calculation of one moment immediately affects states of other time zones. Ex: Reflect future data to current calculation in real-time during error correction.

2. **Time-Crystal Qubits**:
    Qubits based on material with temporal periodicity (Time Crystal). Maintains coherence with self-oscillation cycle without external interference, implementing intrinsic timing synchronization of quantum gate operations.

3. **Hypertemporal Parallelism**:
    Structure where a single algorithm executes simultaneously at multiple points on the time axis. Ex: When cracking code, combine calculation paths of past and future with quantum superposition to derive answer via "Temporal Parallelism".

---

### **3. Time-Sliced Quantum RAM**

* **Concept**:
  * Split memory into **Temporal Layers**, not spatial layers.
  * Example:
    * *"Multi-Timeline Storage"*: Identical physical qubit holds different values simultaneously in multiple time zones.
    * *"Time Compression Restoration"*: Rollback immediately to backup state of specific time zone upon error occurrence.
  * **Application**:
    * Temporal Parallel Processing (Calculate past version and present version simultaneously to select optimal result).
    * Temporal Pattern Extraction in Quantum Machine Learning (e.g., Overlay past data trends to future prediction).

---

### 📌 **Commonality**

* Treat **"Time = 5th Qubit"**, making time itself a computational resource besides space/state.

* An attempt to break through limitations of existing quantum computing with **Temporal Flexibility**.
* Of course, realistic implementation is yet impossible, but presents a new paradigm in theoretical exploration level!
