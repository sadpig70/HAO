# HAO: Human AI Orchestra

[![HAO Infographic](hao_infographic.png)](hao_infographic.png)

**A next-generation collaborative development framework maximizing synergy between human intuition and AI diversity.**

---

## 📖 Overview

The **HAO (Human AI Orchestra)** engine transforms the role of a human developer from a "coder" to a "conductor," orchestrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve creative and robust engineering results. This repository contains the core methodology, technical specifications, and actual project outputs generated using this framework.

> **Note**: This repository serves as both a methodology archive and a portfolio of the "Proof of Concept" projects executed via HAO.

## 📚 Key Documents

* **[HAO Technology Specification (Developer Manual)](HAO_Specification.md)**
  * The core manual detailing the **11-Step Collaborative Workflow**.
  * Contains specific prompt examples for Idea Generation, Systematization, Evaluation, and Decision Making.
  * Read this to understand *how* to use HAO.

* **[PPR & Gantree Guide](PPR_Gantree_V4.md)**
  * Technical guide for **Gantree** (Tree-based System Design Notation) and **PPR** (Purposeful-Programming Revolution DSL).
  * These are the tools used in Steps 6-11 of the HAO workflow.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Dancing with Noise (The Sentinel Stack)

An infrastructure immune system that turns "noise" (errors/anomalies) into a resource for predictive defense.

* **Outcome**: A 4-layer architecture including `Sentinel Detect`, `Adapt`, `Redteam`, and `Live`.

### 2. Dancing with Time (TQC Platform)

A quantum computing platform that treats "time" as an active computational resource to overcome hardware limitations.

* **Outcome**: A "Software-First" TQC platform integrating `TLQP` (Time Layered) and `TMQP` (Time Multiplexed) architectures.
